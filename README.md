# AOC-2023

Provides a simple app for solving Advent of Code tasks. (visit https://adventofcode.com/)

Solving AoC tasks requires some account that will give you a special input prepared for you.
Every user can have a different solution for a given task.

To solve the above requirement, the app allows the user to toggle between local storage file and a network connection.
Either replace a file stored in LocalTaskData with your input, or alternatively put your cookie data in an **APIService** file.

App also contains a time measurement that shows you how long it took to find a proper solution.
